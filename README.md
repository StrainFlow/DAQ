# Omniverse DAQ

This extension lets you track the position, velocity and acceleration of a PRIM. 

Type the path of the prim into the field at the top to set the prim you track. Click the clear button to reset the charts.

I like to add a ground plane, a sphere, and a physics material with a high coefficient of restitution to the scene and track the sphere whith the simulation running.
